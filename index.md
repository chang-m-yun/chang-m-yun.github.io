## Bio:
I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University in Chemical Engineering, advised by Anshul Kundaje in Computer Science & Genetics. My current research focuses on modeling and engineering molecular-scale biology using deep learning methods.

For my undergraduate, I studied Chemical Engineering at Columbia University, with research in electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 using non-toxic, earth-abundant metals with Ponisseril Somasundaran.  
For my Master's, I studied Biotechnology at the University of Cambridge, with research in engineering bacterial endospores for DNA data storage with Graham Christie.

## Projects:
#### A unified lexicon of predictive DNA sequence motifs from ENCODE transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility assays

___Figure:___ _MotifCompendium: A GPU-accelerated Python package for clustering, annotating, and managing motifs, at scale. Example process collapsing FOX dimer motif, starting from TF ChIP-seq BPNet-derived motifs into ENCODE TF MotifCompendium pattern. The process was completed on the ENCODE Project, across 19,739 TF ChIP-seq BPNet-derived motifs, resulting in 1,921 unique motif patterns._
